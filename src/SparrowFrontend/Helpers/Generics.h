/*
There are 4 types of generics:
 - function generics
     - these are function that either have CT types as parameters, or have some concepts as
     parameters
     - when they are instantiated, some parameters may not be present for the instantiation
     - we distinguish between bound params (params that must be fixed before instantiation) and
     final params (params that are present in the final instantiation)
     - the concept parameters will become both bound and final params
     - we can have dependent types (a param type depends on the actual types of previous params)
 - class generics
     - all parameters must be CT
     - all parameters are considered to be bound params
     - there are no RT nor non-bound params
 - package generics
     - all parameters must be CT
     - all parameters are considered to be bound params
     - there are no RT nor non-bound params
 - concept declarations
     - the "type models concept" relation is implemented with generic instantiations
     - the concept will hold instantiations for each type that satisfies it

All concepts may have if-clauses. These are predicates that will be checked before instantiation.
IF they don't compile, or their (CT) evaluation return false, the instantiation fails.

Node organization:
- we have an Instantiation, as a part of InstantiationSet, which is a part of a generic node
- the instantiation object will contain the following:
    - the list of bound variables (created at Inst node creation)
    - then, in the same context (but not as part of it), will add:
        - the if clause
        - the copy of the node that is instantiated

Terminology:
- bound params: parameters that must be fixed to before creating the instantiation; used to
differentiate between instantiations
- non-bound params: all the parameter that are non-bound; RT parameters
- final params: the params that are passed to the instantiated function; the RT params and the
concept params
- bound vars: the variables created to hold the values for the bound params
- bound values: the CT values used to initialize the bound vars
- generic params: the list of params with nulls in the positions of non-bound params
- dependent param: a parameter for which it's type expression depends on the previous params

We distinguish between partial instantiation and full instantiation. The partial instantiation is
just a copy of the bound parameters/vars and the check of the if clause. In this partial
instantiation we don't copy/check the resulting decl. We use partial instantiations in the overload
procedure to check which generic decls can be called with the given set of arguments. Based on this
process, we may have multiple instantiations that are callable, but in the end they will not be
selected. We create full instantiations only for the selected callables. For a full instantiation
we also clone the original declaration, and semantic check it.
Any errors in compiling the partial instantiation, will make the generic not callable. Any errors in
the full instantiation (if partial instantiation succeeded) will be reported.

For generic functions, we are building the partial instantiations iteratively. If we find some
errors, we may even leave the partial instantiations incomplete.

To check if we have dependent parameters, we check the type node of the param to contain an
identifier that refers to any of the previously seen parameters. If we detected that a parameter is
dependent, then we don't compute it's type. It will be added to the generic params, but with a null
type. A dependent param will be treated as if the type was 'AnyType', and we add an extra condition
for instantiation. A dependent param will therefore be treated as a concept param.
